# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data
## About this project and Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree Program
This project aims to aid the understanding of data wrangling. In this project, I will be run through the "Gather-Access-Clean-Analyze" process to get useful insights from raw data.<br>
The data used in this project is called [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs). WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. It has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
## How to run this project
The coding environment is Python, including the following:
<li>Numpy</li>
<li>Pandas</li>
<li>requests(download data)</li>
<li>tweepy(API)</li>
<li>json(API)</li>
<li>Seaborn</li>
<li>Matplotlib</li>

The data contains three parts:<br>
**Enhanced Twitter Archive**(included as csv):The WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets, but not everything.<br>
**Additional Data via the Twitter API**:  Retweet count and favorite count are two of the notable column omissions. You're going to query Twitter's API to gather this valuable data.
**Image Predictions File**: A table full of image predictions (the top three only) alongside each tweet ID, image URL, and the image number that corresponded to the most confident prediction.

You can download the ipynb to run it with Jupyter Notebook(don't forget to download csv sheet as well) or view as a HTML.
This project is organized with 3 parts.<br>
**Part I - Probability<br>
Part II - A/B Test<br>
Part III - Regression**<br>
In each part I manipulated the given data to answer the given questions.
